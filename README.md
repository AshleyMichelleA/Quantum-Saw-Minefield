PROBLEM SCENARIO

Imagine you are in the very famous horror movie called SAW , you wake up in a random hallway and John Kramer , the “Jigsaw Killer” tells you that to escape and win the game you have to just go through the red door that is on the other side of the hallway 

Sounds pretty easy huh? But here is the catch: 

It's a pitch black hallway and there is a light sensitive bomb between you and the door  . 

He provides you with one tool to help you : A Photon Beam Laser. 

Luckily he gives you a very important detail: it could or could not be active , but you have to figure that out.

You have to pass the hallway without the bomb exploding, so how can you do this ?


You have 1 hour … if you run out of time,  KABOOM!



PROBLEM SOLVING

Should you use the Classical Method ?

The way that you would know if a bomb is active or not  in the classical way is by firing a single photon and seeing whether or not it explodes, proving that there was a bomb. However the problem with this is that if it was active it would explode and you would lose.

So how can we approach this?

Luckily you are into quantum mechanics and you know about the Elitzur-Vaidman Bomb test  !!!

In 1993 Elitzur and Vaidman concluded that you could find out the bomb is present without exploding it by using superposition.

Putting the photon into Superposition means  that the photon is in a limbo state where there's a chance that the photon is going either along the upper path of the system or the lower path which is where the container is at. This limbo state is 'collapsed' which means the photon is out of superposition and is definitely in one position or another. Collapsing the photon's superposition is done by observing or measuring the photon which occurs when the container has our bomb inside.

You take a source that can produce those single photons , 
then you send the photons through a beam splitter that can create a SUPERPOSITION(its a sum of the two possible paths that the photon could go , )

Let's assume the two paths of the photon are the same so 50% 50%

Along each possible path there is a mirror so that the path meet again and where they meet there is another beam splitter, if nothing else happens that second beam splitter will just reverse the effect of the first, so the photon continues in the same direction as before the reason is that two paths of the photon interfere like sound s waves interfere in the one direction they interfere destructively  so they cancel each other out 0% in the other direction they add together to 100%(constructive interference)
.
We place the detector where we want the proton to go and call it detector a.
And will call the destructive interference detector b

If its not active , nothing happens , but if it active and didn't explode we know the photons in the upper path the second beam splitter has nothing to recombine and splits at the end  and it is then Detected at a or b  going through detector a and b

So…

Live bomb-50%
Detector A-  25%
Detector B - 25 %

If the photon is detected at A, we still don't know if the photon is love or dead because that's the same 
result BUT  if it's detected at photon B that can only happen if the bomb is live and didn't explode
And that tells us something about the path that the photon didnt take.


There is a 25% of knowing if the bomb is present but how can we improve it to 0%?

USING THE QUANTUM ZENO EFFECT
It's a way  we can manipulate the probability of the superpositioned photon by repeatedly measuring it. Each measurement disturbs the system and resets its evolution, which can prevent it from transitioning to a different state, in this case, the state where the bomb explodes. So in our Saw game technically the photon should go through the upper path of the hadamard gate most of the time .
